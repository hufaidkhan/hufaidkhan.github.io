I have worked with other API however mostly with static urls. This one was a bit harder because I had to change request depending on the input as well. I am currently working on filterting by region. I did make it work however I had to change some tags to make options field editable, another new thing I found out recently. Instead of changing it via JS I tried to change to list tags but instead the functionality stopped working. Another hard thing I did not manage yet, is changing country borders.
